/* LOOPS!
While Loops
With a while loop, you can execute code repeatably as long as a certain condition is fulfilled. It is written with the while keyword followed by a condition wrapped in round brackets and a code block that contains the body of the loop wrapped in curly brackets.

while (condition) {
  // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}

do {
  // The code here will always be executed once and then
  // repeatedly while the condition is true.
} while (condition);

switch (x) {
  case option1:
    // code that is executed when "x === option1" is true
    break;
  case option2:
    // code that is executed when "x === option2" is true
    break;
  default:
    // code that is executed when x does not equal any of the options
}
